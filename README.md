# Work in progress

Hydroponic greenhouse cultivation is based on the use of water as a base material, adding nutritive solutions to them, so as not to depend on the quality of the soil or the climate. The operation of this one, constitutes a complex system, since, any change of the parameters necessary for the culture, that is to say: Water flow, temperature, humidity, luminosity, CO 2 and mineral concentration in the water (the main variables affecting the greenhouse), however minimal, have an effect on the development of the crop. It is here, where the constant monitoring and control of the variables already indicated becomes essential to obtain an optimal development of the crop.

On a large scale, the progressive decrease in production is caused mainly by the decrease in the amount of nutrients in the soils of the crop, which is why different companies and study centers are interested in investigating and developing the implementation of different alternatives such as hydroponic greenhouses, in order to study the feasibility of a crop with these characteristics.

The intention of this project is to evaluate a design capable of monitoring and controlling the main variables already described, which influence production in a greenhouse hydroponic, through the implementation of sensors and actuators connected to a control device, this can be, a microcontroller or a microprocessor, depending on the computing power required. Finally, the information collected, it is intended to be sent wirelessly to a man-machine interface, in which the state of the variables in the greenhouse can be monitored.
